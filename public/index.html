            <p class="info">"During the presidential race, Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign spent millions at his properties. 
                When he became the presumptive nominee, Republican campaign committees followed suit. 
                Since his inauguration, federal officials have continued the pattern, spending taxpayer 
                money at his hotels, golf clubs and restaurants. ProPublica has collected the details of 
                this spending since 2015."</p>
